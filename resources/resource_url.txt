Notes:
Need to redo Medgen and NCI
Medgen id and umls id are the same so need to combine. However Medgen id has different mapping to MONDO, HPO and other vs UMLS has mapping to more EHR ontology
NCI has its own ontology - need to ingest core also ingest mapping
OMIM will be very nice to have
MedDRA is not free, so will create a nodes based on the mapping available for cross referencing
ICO-3 will be good to have for oncology
KEGG needs to be ingested also
